## Homework Assignment 1

Submit the following by ______. 

### Part 1 

In your `README.md` answer the following questions with True or False. 

1. `(5)==(5,)` returns True
2. Any of the following: (integer, string, list) can be the key of a dictionary.
3. Any of the following: (integer, string, list) can be the value of a dictionary.
4. Any of the following: (integer, string, list) can be in a set.
5. `s[0]="a"` would result in an error if s is a string.
6. If `a = [(1,2),(3,4)]` performing `a[0]=3` would result in an error.
7. If a key k is not in a dictionary d, then `d[k]` will return None.
8. If `((x==y)!=(x is y))` is False, then x is an alias of y.
9. If you were to open and read (so in \r" mode) a file that does not exist, Python will error out.

### Part 2

Please submit the following in a file named `anagram.py`.

1. An anagram is direct word switch or word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. Uppercase and lowercase letters are considered the same and you may add white spaces wherever you want. For example, the name "Tom Marvolo Riddle" can be rearranged the sentence "I am Lord Voldemort". Now, given two strings a and b, write a function `isAnagram(a, b)` which returns True if a and b are anagrams of one another, and False otherwise. You may not use any sorting functionality.

### Part 3 

Please submit the following in a file named `permutation.py`.

1. For a list of integers L of length n, write a function `isPermutation(L)` returns True if L is a re-ordering of the integers from 1 up to n and False otherwise. For example, if `L = [1,2,4,3,5]`, `isPermutation(L)` should return True, because since n = 5, L is just a reordering of the numbers from 1 to 5. `L = [1,3,2,5,4]` would also return True. If `L = [1,2,3,-5,8,0]`, `isPermutation(L)` should return False. Similarly, `isPermutation([1,1,2,3,4,5])` should return False. You may not use any sorting functionality.
